P2P example: https://medium.com/@carloslfu/make-a-p2p-connection-in-10-minutes-57d9559fd1c
- node.js
- no servers
- security is hard...

PeerJS: https://peerjs.com/
- node.js
- needs a server for establishing connections (can be hosted on repl.it or something)
- somewhat easier security

Working app example: http://moose-team.github.io/friends/
- node.js
- no server needed, "bots" can be used to seed the channel when noone is online
- it's missing security/encryption
- can also work via bluetooth
